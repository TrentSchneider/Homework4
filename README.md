## Description
This is a site demonstrating my abilities with JS DOM. The site goes through a JS quiz, allows the user to enter their initials to add a high score, and shows a high score list.

## Installation
There is no installation needed as this will work with any browser.

## Usage
The user will select the start button in order to begin the quiz. The user will then be presented with mutliple choice questions. Once the user goes through all of the questions or runs out of time, they will be presented with their score (based off of the remaining time) and the ability to enter their initials. After entering their initials, they will be taken to a high score page, where there is a sorted list of scores, a button to take the user back to the quiz, and a button to clear the high score list.

## Credits
Some code ideas for the final code is based on the base code from Medium.com,  Stackoverflow.com user CodingIntrigue (https://stackoverflow.com/users/571194/codingintrigue), or was coded by Trenton Schneider. You can find Trenton's work on Github at https://github.com/TrentSchneider
